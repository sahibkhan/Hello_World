### To be continued...

Congratulations. You made it this far.

I hope you were following the tutorial step by step and not just skipping over the chapters :)

I have received good feedback so far so I decided to start writing a book. [Click here](http://artofphp.com/) to learn more about that.

But don't worry, I will also keep working on this tutorial. I was a bit lazy over the summer but now that it getting colder again I will have much more time to spend on the tutorial.

If you got something out of the tutorial I would appreciate a star. It's the only way for me to see if people are actually reading this :)



Thanks for your time,

Patrick
